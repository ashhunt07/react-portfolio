			<h2>Nei Yang Gong</h2>
			
			<p>
				Nei Yang Gone is an ancient Chinese practice that consists of still and slow moving meditative poses. Each gentle movement directs the flow of the life force known as Chi into and through the body.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Chi becomes outf balance when strains are put onto the body or mind and using Nei Yang Gong is used to restore this balance. The practice is used in China as a preventative medicine and promotes self-healing in the forms of: health, relaxation, calming the mind and increasing overall well-being.

			<h2>Thought Behind the Color</h2>
				
			<h3>Energy</h3>
			
			<p>
				Because Chi is an energy that flows into and through the body, color gradients were chosen rather than solid colors in order to evoke an emotional response.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Colors chosen to use throughout the design are based on Chinese culture and their beliefs in each color. Chi is represented in a human form so that children can relate to it and see it as themselves. When their chi is sad it will show as a dark color and when Chi is feeling great it will be brighter and happier tones. As a workout session progresses the colors will shift, glow and change to represent the good feelings they will feel when they follow all of the motions.
